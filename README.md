===========

Implementation of numerical methods to solve ordinary differential equation

Known issues, bugs:
At the moment, only the simple euler method is implemented,
pathological equations will end up horrible and the code is not lispy yet.

Future plans:
Rewrite the current code.
Implement runge kutta in the future.
